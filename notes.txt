Reducing probability of dynamite by factor of about 0.5 seems to be best (vs 0.7 setting):
Final outcome balance 0.50: 477 - 523
Final outcome balance 0.70: 506 - 494
Final outcome balance 0.85: 552 - 448
Final outcome balance 1.00: 580 - 420
Final outcome balance 1.20: 634 - 366
Final outcome balance 1.35: 674 - 326
Final outcome balance 1.50: 702 - 298
Final outcome balance 2.00: 816 - 184


Could be that system currently over-estimates how often to play water, hence rarely choosing dynamite is better.
May want to accout for fact that not only does R beat S and W, but it also draws against Rock??
- Not that important as everything draws against itself.


-------------------

Could add counter-prediction model guessing own chances and reducing by that times factor of 0.1 to encourage 
being hard to predict.
Could run it based on a simpler model i.e. just 1st order to avoid perfect self-prediction issue.
